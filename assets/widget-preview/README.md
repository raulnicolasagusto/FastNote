# Widget Preview Images

This folder contains preview images shown when users add widgets to their home screen.

## Required Image:

- **note-widget-preview.png** - Preview of the Note widget (320x120dp minimum)
  - Recommended size: 640x240 pixels (2x for better quality)
  - Shows what the widget looks like before being added

## How to create:

1. Take a screenshot of an actual widget instance
2. Crop to widget boundaries
3. Save as PNG with transparent or white background
4. Place in this folder as `note-widget-preview.png`

For now, the app will use the app icon as fallback.
